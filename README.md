ABOUT:

This project is able to accept a stock ticker symbol and display information about it, such as the current price, a graph of the historical stock high and low prices, and ratings for stock metrics such as the P/E ratio. 

You can run this program with the command "npm start".



TOOLING:

I used React to build the user interface.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses the API provided by Financial Modeling Prep (https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) for its 
stock data and the charting library Recharts (http://recharts.org/en-US/) to generate the graphs.
